Around this time, the NFL playoffs and coming of the Super Bowl enter the forefront of our minds. Not so much in recent years, but in the late 80s there were very few black quarterbacks in the NFL, and there was an undercurrent sense that black athletes did not possess the leadership qualities and instincts that it took to be successful in that position. Well, on this day, January 31, 1988, all of that thinking changed, thanks to one man, our brother Doug Williams. This is his triumphant story of victory. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4110,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DougWilliams4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4110\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Douglas “Doug” Lee Williams attended Grambling State University where he played under our brother, head coach Eddie Robinson. As quarterback, Doug guided the Tigers to a 36–7 (.837 winning percentage) record as a four-year starter, and led the Tigers to three conference championships.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1977, Doug Williams led the NCAA in several passing categories, including total yards from scrimmage, passing yards, and touchdown passes. Doug Williams finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting. Doug Williams graduated from Grambling with a bachelor's degree in education, and he began work on his master's degree before the 1978 NFL Draft.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite the success that he enjoyed on the field, a coach from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (HOF coach Joe Gibbs) was the only NFL coach that visited him for scouting purposes. Impressed by his poise, work ethic, and studious nature, the coach rated Williams as the best quarterback in the draft and recommended that the Buccaneers select Williams with their first-round draft choice.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4108,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DougWilliams6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4108\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Following the recommendation of Gibbs, Tampa Bay drafted Williams in the first round (17th overall) of the 1978 NFL Draft. Williams became the first black quarterback taken in the first round of an NFL draft. His first preseason pass drew a standing ovation from the Tampa Stadium crowd. In a 1979 game against the Chicago Bears, Doug Williams and our brother, Bears quarterback Vince Evans made history by making it the first NFL game ever to have a black starting quarterback on both teams.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tampa Bay, which had won just two games in the first two years of the franchise, went to the playoffs three times in five seasons with Williams as starter and played in the 1979 NFC Championship game. During his time in Tampa Bay, Williams improved his completion percentage each season.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Williams was the only starting black quarterback in the NFL at that time. During his tenure with the Buccaneers, Williams was paid the lowest salary for a starting quarterback in the league, and less than the salary of 12 backups. After the 1982 season, Williams asked for a $600,000 contract. The Tampa Bay Bucs owner refused to budge from his initial offer despite the head coach’s endorsement.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4107,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DougWilliams7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4107\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Feeling disrespected by not being paid properly according to his merit, Doug Williams bolted to the upstart United States Football League's (USFL) Oklahoma Outlaws. The next season the Bucs went 2–14, and did not make the playoffs again until the 1997 season 14 years later. Over time, Tampa Bay’s willingness to let Doug Williams walk away over such a relatively small amount of money was seen as insensitive, especially as it came only months after Doug Williams’ wife passed away suddenly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1984, Williams led the Outlaws of the USFL in passing, however, after the USFL was shut down in 1986, Doug Williams returned to the NFL, joining the Washington Redskins. He was reunited with his former offensive coordinator, Joe Gibbs, who was now the team's head coach. Initially, Williams served as the backup for the starting quarterback, but after the starter became injured, Doug Williams stepped in and led the Redskins to an opening-day victory against the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1987 season.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4112,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DougWilliams2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4112\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Doug Williams would start three times in the 1987 regular season. While the subsequent two starts were losses, at the end of the season, when the Redskins had qualified for the playoffs, Williams was chosen as the starter. And on this day, January 31, 1988, before an international audience, he bravely led the team to Super Bowl XXII in which they routed John Elway and the Denver Broncos, becoming the first black quarterback to both play in and win a Super Bowl. He threw for a record (at the time) of 340 yards (and four touchdowns), and he was named the Most Valuable Player of the championship game.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4111,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DougWilliams3-770x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4111\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He suffered from injuries the following season and was outplayed by the bench player, who eventually won the starting job from Williams. Doug Williams would play one final season in 1989, as a backup.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Following his departure from the NFL, Williams worked on television in 1990 as a college football analyst for the Black Entertainment Television (BET).&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite enjoying the change of pace, Williams longed to return to football and when a high school head coaching position opened up in 1991 at a new high School in Louisiana, Doug Williams applied for the job and was hired for the position.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1992, Williams was able to move on to coach to his former high school. Playing its home games on a field bearing his name, Doug Williams was able to lead the team to an undefeated regular season.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Williams moved to the collegiate coaching ranks in 1994, when he was hired as the running backs coach for the football team of the United States Naval Academy. His other jobs in football have also included work as an offensive coordinator and as a scout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Doug Williams began his collegiate head coaching career at Morehouse College in 1997. He was named the head football coach at Grambling State University the following year, succeeding the legendary Eddie Robinson.

The Arsenio Hall Show was aimed primarily at the younger black audience. However, the show quickly appealed to people of all races and began to attract a wide variety of guests. It quickly became the “cool” place for entertainers to go to in order to reach the younger generation.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Around this time, his cross-over into the mainstream as a leading media personality was evident as he hosted the&nbsp;<em><u>MTV Video Music Awards</u></em>&nbsp;during the network’s “<em>Golden Era</em>” from 1988-1991.

He was the portrait of the image and style of the time period known as the “<em>Harlem Renaissance</em>.” This is his story.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Born Cabell Calloway III on December 25, 1907, in Rochester, New York. His mother was a Morgan State College graduate, teacher, and church organist. His father, Cabell Calloway Jr., graduated from Lincoln University in 1898, and worked as a lawyer and in real estate. The family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, when he was 11. Soon after, his father passed away and his mother remarried.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Young Cabell grew up in West Baltimore. He often skipped school to earn money by selling newspapers, shining shoes, and cooling down horses at the Pimlico racetrack where he developed an interest in racing and betting on horses. After he was caught playing dice on the church steps, his mother sent him to a reform school run by his uncle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Calloway resumed hustling when he returned to Baltimore and worked as a caterer while he improved his studies in school. He began private vocal lessons in the early 20s and studied music throughout his formal schooling. Despite his parents' and teachers' disapproval of his interest in jazz, he began performing in nightclubs in Baltimore.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It should be noted that Cab Calloway was a standout athlete. He played on his high school basketball team, and in his senior year he started playing professional basketball with a team in the Negro Basketball League. After graduating from high school, he would later turn down an opportunity to play basketball for the famed <em>Harlem Globetrotters</em>, because he wanted to pursue a career in entertainment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1927, Cab Calloway joined his older sister, Blanche, on tour for the popular black musical revue&nbsp;<em><u>Plantation Days</u></em>. His sister became an accomplished bandleader before him, and he often attributed her as his inspiration for entering show business. Cab Calloway's mother wanted him to be a lawyer (like his father), so once the tour ended, he enrolled in college in Illinois, but he was more interested in singing and entertaining.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cab Calloway spent most of his nights in Chicago nightclubs, performing as a singer, drummer, and master of ceremonies (MC). One evening he had the pleasure of meeting, and performing with, our brother, Louis Armstrong, who taught him to sing in the “<em>scat</em>” style. He then left college to sing with a band.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1929, Cab Calloway relocated to New York to lead the band. They had one notable performance, but they soon later broke up. Louis Armstrong recommended Cab Calloway as a replacement singer in the musical revue <em><u>Connie's Hot Chocolates</u></em>. He established himself as a vocalist singing \"<em>Ain't Misbehavin'</em>\" by our brother, Fats Waller. While Calloway was performing in the revue, he impressed another band, who thereafter asked Cab Calloway to be their lead vocalist. The band would eventually be known as “<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cab Calloway and his Orchestra</span>.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3364,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CabCalloway6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3364\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1930, Cab Calloway got a gig at Harlem's famed <em>Cotton Club</em>. Soon, the bandleader became a regular performer at the popular nightspot. Cab Calloway hit the big time with \"<em>Minnie the Moocher</em>\" (1931). The song became iconic, and he would go on to become the first black recording artist to sell at least one million copies from a single. The tune's famous call-and-response \"hi-de-hi-de-ho\" chorus (improvised when he couldn't recall a lyric), became Cab Calloway's signature phrase for the rest of his career.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cab Calloway’s popularity and talents in entertainment led him to crossover into movies as well.

Shortly after his birth, young Eric was adopted and raised by his mother's grandparents. His grandmother was a domestic worker and nursery operator, and his grandfather worked in landscaping. He has often acknowledged his grandmother's influence in his life as one of the greatest reasons for his success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eric began playing the piano when he was five years old. He had a strict Baptist upbringing, and as a teenager he was a part-time pianist and choir leader at a local church. His natural talent for telling jokes was evident in elementary school, when his 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;grade teacher would use him, as a class reward: with good behavior from his classmates, young Eric would get the chance to formally tell them jokes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eric Bishop attended Terrell High School, where he received top grades and played basketball and football. His ambition was to play for the Dallas Cowboys, and he set passing records as a quarterback. He also sang in a band called “<em>Leather and Lace</em>.” After completing high school, Eric received a college scholarship to a school in San Diego, where he studied musical and performing arts composition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3223,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JamieFoxx2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3223\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Leaving college, Eric moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in comedy. Eric first told jokes at a comedy club's open mic night in 1989, after accepting a girlfriend's dare. When he noticed that female comedians were often called upon first to perform, he serendipitously created the stage name “<em>Jamie Foxx</em>,” feeling that it was a name ambiguous enough to prevent any biases from the crowd and clever enough to help him get on stage. It is worth noting that he chose his surname as a tribute to our brother, the legendary comedian Redd Foxx.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1991, he was hired as a regular cast member on the classic variety show&nbsp;<em><u>In Living Color</u></em>. He went on to become one of the most outstanding cast members during the show’s tenure on FOX. Jamie left In Living Color in 1994, but in 1996 he returned to television with&nbsp;<em><u>The Jamie Foxx Show</u></em>, playing a struggling actor who lives in a hotel owned by his aunt and uncle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jamie Foxx also began professionally exploring his interest in music during the 1990s. On a Christmas episode of&nbsp;<em><u>In Living Color</u></em>, Jamie sang Donny Hathaway’s “<em>This Christmas</em>” over the closing credits and a public interest in his voice soon followed. In 1994, he released&nbsp;<em><u>Peep This</u></em>, an R&amp;B album, that reached No. 12 on the Billboard charts, led by the single “<em>Infatuation</em>.”&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3225,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JamieFoxx7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3225\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the time his TV show ended in 2001, Foxx was beginning to be viewed as a talented dramatic actor. This was due in large part to his performance in the sports drama&nbsp;<em><u>Any Given Sunday</u></em>&nbsp;(1999). Playing the fictional football star “<em>Willie Beamen</em>,” Jamie Foxx showed incredible range in his performance, and proved that his TV charisma was translatable on the big screen.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>His next notable film role was in Michael Mann's&nbsp;<em><u>Ali</u></em>&nbsp;(2001), playing Muhammad Ali’s loquacious cornerman.

As an infant, he was raised by his grandmother. Sammy Davis's parents split up when he was three and he went to live with his father, who was working as an entertainer in a dance troupe. When his father and adopted uncle went on tour, young Sammy was brought along, and after learning to tap dance the three began performing together. They would eventually be dubbed the&nbsp;<em><u>Will Mastin Trio</u></em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3137,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SammyDavisJr10.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3137\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because of the group's nomadic lifestyle, Sammy Davis, Jr. never received a formal education, though his father did occasionally hire tutors while they were on the road. During their travels in the 1930s, the young Davis not only became an accomplished dancer but also a skilled singer, multi-instrumentalist and comedian and was soon the star of the show. Sammy Davis also made his first appearance in film during this time, dancing in the 1933 short film&nbsp;<em><u>Rufus Jones for President</u></em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1943, at the height of World War II, Davis’s career was interrupted when he was drafted into the Army. During his service, he directly experienced horrendous racial prejudice that his father had previously protected him from.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He was constantly harassed and physically abused by white soldiers (he suffered a broken nose from an attack by a white soldier). But Sammy Davis eventually found refuge in an entertainment regiment, where he discovered that performing allowed him a certain measure of safety and he enjoyed the challenge of earning the respect of even his most difficult audience members.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the war, Davis resumed his showbiz career. He continued to perform with the Will Mastin Trio as the star of the act and also struck out on his own, singing in nightclubs and recording records. His career began to rise to new heights in 1947 when the trio opened for Frank Sinatra (with whom Davis would remain a lifelong friend and collaborator) at the Capitol Theatre in New York. A tour followed, as did a performance that caught the ear of a record company, who signed Sammy Davis to a recording contract in 1954.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3130,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SammyDavisJr6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3130\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Later that year, while driving to Los Angeles for a soundtrack recording, Davis was seriously injured in a car accident. The accident resulted in his losing an eye, and he would use a glass eye for most of his life. His recuperation also gave him time for deep reflection. He converted to Judaism shortly thereafter, finding commonalities between the oppression experienced by black American and Jewish communities.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Davis’s injury did not slow his ascent. In 1955 his first two albums (<em><u>Starring Sammy Davis Jr</u></em>. and <em><u>Sammy Davis Jr. Sings Just for Lovers</u></em>) were released to both critical acclaim and commercial success, which in turn led to headlining performances in Las Vegas and New York as well as further appearances in films and on television shows.

In fact, he is credited with helping integrate popular tourist destinations like Las Vegas and Miami Beach. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Davis also challenged the bigotry of the era by marrying a white actress at a time when interracial marriages were forbidden by law in 31 states.

In 1989, he joined the artist Jaz-O — an older gentleman who served as a mentor — to record a song called \"<em>The Originators</em>,\" which garnered the pair an appearance on an episode of&nbsp;<em><u>Yo! MTV Raps</u></em>. It was at this point that Shawn embraced the nickname “<em>Jay-Z</em>,” which has three layers, (1) it is an homage to his friend Jaz-O, (2) a play on his childhood nickname “<em>Jazzy</em>,” and (3) a reference to the J/Z subway station near his Brooklyn home.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even with a stage name, Jay-Z remained relatively anonymous until he and two friends, Damon Dash and Kareem Burke, founded their own record label, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Roc-a-Fella Records</span>, in 1996.

He attended a segregated elementary school and was not allowed to participate in activities at his high school because of his race. The teachers actively discouraged black students from seeking higher education. After the death of his mother when he was 14, Gordon left home. He lived with relatives for a short time before setting off on his own, taking whatever odd jobs he could find.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Gordon Parks purchased his first camera at the age of 25 after viewing photographs of migrant workers in a magazine. His early fashion photographs caught the attention of Marva Louis, wife of our brother, “<em>The Brown Bomber</em>,” boxing champ Joe Louis, who encouraged Gordon Parks to move to a larger city. Gordon and his wife relocated to Chicago in 1940.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Gordon Parks began to explore subjects beyond portraits and fashion photographs in Chicago. He became interested in the low-income Black neighborhoods of Chicago's South Side. In 1941, Parks won a photography fellowship with the Farm Security Administration (FSA) for his images of the inner city.

Additionally, as a young man, he earned the nickname \"<em>Bojangles</em>\" for his combative tendencies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the age of five, young Bill Robinson began dancing for a living, performing in local beer gardens. In 1886, at the age of nine, he joined a touring troupe. In 1891, he joined another traveling company, later performing as a vaudeville act. He achieved great success as a nightclub and musical-comedy performer. At this stage of his career, he performed almost exclusively in black theaters.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1908, Bill Robinson met a man who eventually became his manager. He urged Robinson to develop his solo act in nightclubs. Bill Robinson took a break from performance to serve as a rifleman in World War I.

Drake grew up with music in his blood. His father was a drummer for the legendary rock star Jerry Lee Lewis. His uncle played bass for the funk band, Sly and the Family Stone.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Drake comes from a distinctive ethnic and religious background. His father is a black American Catholic and his mother is a white Canadian Jew. Speaking about his personal identity, Drake says: \"<em>At the end of the day, I consider myself a Black man because I'm more immersed in Black culture than any other. Being Jewish is kind of a cool twist. It makes me unique</em>.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old, and he was raised by his mother in affluent and predominantly Jewish neighborhood in Toronto. He attended Jewish day school, had a Bar Mitzvah at age 13 and observed the Jewish High Holy Days. Despite his Jewish upbringing, Drake says he felt isolated at his virtually all-white school. He has said that \"<em>nobody understood what it was like to be Black and Jewish</em>,\" but added that \"<em>being different from everyone else just made me a lot stronger</em>.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was one of Drake's classmates at Forest Hill who gave him his start in the entertainment industry. One of his classmates’ father was an agent, whom suggested to his son that if he knew any classmates with talent, that he should connect them for an audition. Drake was successful in the audition and thereby secured artistic representation.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Shortly thereafter, in 2001, Drake landed a role on the Canadian teen drama series&nbsp;<em><u>Degrassi: The Next Generation</u></em>. The show followed the dramatic lives of a group of teenagers at Degrassi High School, and Drake played the part of “<em>Jimmy Brooks</em>,” a basketball star who becomes permanently wheelchair-bound when he is shot by a classmate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Drake dropped out of school to pursue his acting career. (he would eventually graduate in 2012). He starred on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Degrassi</em></span> for seven years (2001-2009. The show quickly developed a devoted cult following propelling him to celebrity status in Canada, though he remained relatively anonymous in the United States.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While he was still appearing on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Degrassi</em></span>, Drake began attempting to cross over into the world of hip-hop. He released his first mixtape, <em><u>Room for Improvement</u></em>, in 2006, achieving modest sales. He followed that with the 2007 release of another mixtape, <em><u>Comeback Season</u></em>, on his own <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">October’s Very Own</span> label (later to be shortened to OVO). This included Drake's first hit single and music video, \"<em>Replacement Girl</em>,\" which was featured as the New Joint of the Day on BET's popular hip-hop TV show 106 &amp; Park. More significantly, the song contained a version of the song \"<em>Man of the Year</em>,\" which featured Lil Wayne. Drake decided to leave Wayne’s verses and hook intact while he provided the rest of the lyrics himself. This caught the attention of Jas Prince, son of Rap-A-Lot Records founder James “J” Prince, who decided to play Drake to Lil Wayne himself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 2008, the producers of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Degrassi</em></span> overhauled the cast, eliminating Drake's character. Without his steady source of income, and not yet making significant money as a rapper, Drake was on the verge not making it further in the entertainment industry. But early in 2008, he received an unexpected call from our brother, Lil Wayne, who asked him to board a flight to Houston that night to join his <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Carter III Tour</span>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After touring and recording a number of songs with Lil Wayne, Drake released his third mixtape, <em><u>So Far Gone</u></em>, in February 2009. It featured the infectious single \"<em>Best I Ever Had</em>,\" which peaked at No. 2 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart. A bidding war for Drake’s signature followed and in mid-2009 he inked a record deal with Lil Wayne's, Young Money Entertainment. Since then, Drake's barrage of catchy, R&amp;B-infused hip-hop songs have dominated radio airwaves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In June of 2010, Drake released his first full studio album,&nbsp;<em><u>Thank Me Later</u></em>, which debuted at No. 1 on both American and Canadian album charts and was certified platinum.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In November 2011, he released his second studio album,&nbsp;<em><u>Take Care</u></em>, which included the lead single \"<em>Headlines.</em>\" The album was universally acclaimed, winning the 2013 Grammy award for best rap album, among several other honors.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although his career was flying high, Drake hit a few rough patches in his personal life. He has had public rivalries with several notable rappers including Chris Brown, Joe Budden, and Meek Mill.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, personal obstacles never seem to sidetrack Drake for long. His next two albums went on to receive critical acclaim and commercial success. This was evident in May 2017 when Drake was the big winner at the Billboard Music Awards. He took home 13 awards — including top artist, top male artist, top Billboard 100 album, breaking the record for the artist with the most wins in one year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>His next album,&nbsp;<em><u>Scorpion</u></em>, somehow managed to top the success of his previous album. The album shattered streaming records over its first 24 hours, with a total of over 300 million streams on various music streaming platforms. The pace continued over the next several days, making Drake the first artist to top 1 billion streams in one week, with his studio release.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Drake has parlayed his celebrity into other business ventures outside of music. In 2013, Drake became the new \"<em>global ambassador</em>\" of the Toronto Raptors, joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, while owning naming rights to its practice facility. In 2016, he began a line of bourbon whiskey (Virginia Black) that broke sales records in Canada. Drake has also designed fashion in collaboration with the famous apparel brand Nike. It was reported that in 2018, Drake was responsible for 5% of Toronto's total annual tourism income.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Among the world's best-selling music artists, with over 170 million records sold, Drake is ranked as the highest-certified digital singles artist in the United States. He has won four Grammy Awards, among several other music awards, and he holds several Billboard chart records.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In his relatively short career, our brother Drake has managed to become one of the most successful recording artists of all-time.

Nonetheless, Gregory was a huge success and became a crossover star. In an interview, he said, “<em>It was the first time they had seen a black comic who was not bucking his eyes, wasn't dancing and singing and telling mother-in-law jokes.'

Furthermore, Aida did the all of the choreography for these shows and emerged as the glue that made the Walker-Williams shows work so well, as she worked behind the scenes with her husband supplying the themes and basic ideas for the shows, which then featured the great humor of Bert Williams.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Aida Overton and George Walker married soon after they began performing together.

Their debut album,&nbsp;<em><u>Get It How U Live!!</u></em>&nbsp;(1997), sold more than 400,000 copies.

Her mother was an aspiring entertainer and her father was a carpenter. Her mother created a song-and-dance act for her daughters. With that act, they would have some success, and despite their tender ages, they toured full-time throughout the Southern states during the 1920s, performing at venues for mostly black audiences.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1930, Dorothy’s mom moved to Hollywood, California, and the sisters continued to perform, known as “The Dandridge Sisters”. During the time, they would appear in short films and were booked to perform in high-profile nightclubs throughout the US like the Cotton Club and the Apollo Theater.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the 1940s, Dorothy’s star really began to take off, as she made many appearances on stage and screen. A true entertainment pioneer, throughout her career she would become a black woman of several “firsts.”&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the 1940s, she gained fame for her appearances in “soundies” which were the predecessors of modern-day music videos. These short 3-minute films were played on “movie jukeboxes,” which were extremely popular in those days.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1951, she graced the cover of Ebony magazine, for the controversy surrounding her acclaimed appearance as “<em>Queen Malendi</em>” in the Tarzan movies. In 1953, she landed the leading role in Broadway musical, <em><u>Carmen Jones,</u></em>which was one of the first major Hollywood movies that featured an all-black cast. Her performance in the film would garner her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, becoming the first black female to be so honored. Her appearance in the film left such an impact on viewers that she became known for being the first black sex-symbol in the US.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1955, she performed at the famed Empire Room, in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, becoming the first black person to do so. The success of the event paved the way for other black entertainers to headline there.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1957, she would appear in the film <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>I</em></span><em><u>sland in the Sun</u></em>. This was notable because the film was the first contemporary Hollywood film to depict an interracial relationship. Despite the controversy, the film would go on to receive favorable reviews and strong box-office success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Later in her life, Dorothy would be mired in a variety of lawsuits, financial troubles, and failed marriages.

However, the studio seemed reluctant to star her in feature films. Work was hard to come by in Hollywood because not many movies were interracial, and it was difficult for blacks in show business to find enough work. Although the multi-talented McKinney was lauded for her strikingly beautiful looks, Hollywood was scared of her, and film production codes also prohibited suggestions of interracial relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In December 1932, McKinney moved to Paris, where she performed as a cabaret entertainer. She found the European entertainment industry to be more accepting of her talent, and she toured and performed in numerous films throughout the 1930s. She returned to the United States after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Upon her return to the USA, she would continue her acting career. She would earn starring roles in films aimed at black audiences, but because of racism, she would only be allowed to play stereotypical roles in Hollywood films.

As a teenager, he attended Centennial High School in Compton, where he was a straight-A student.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the 1980s and early 90s, Kendrick grew up around street activities, but he seemed more influenced than harmed by it. He was a good student who enjoyed writing stories, then poems, and then rap lyrics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He adopted the moniker “<em>K-Dot</em>” and began performing his lyrics as a rapper.

He was the youngest of five. His father was a barber and his mother, a schoolteacher.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a kid, Freeman spent a good portion of his time scraping together enough money to see movies. It was by chance that Freeman himself got into acting. He was in junior high school and, as punishment for pulling out a chair from underneath a girl he had a crush on, Freeman was ordered to participate in the school's drama competition. To his surprise, and probably school administrators, the 12-year-old proved to be an immediate natural on the stage, taking top honors in the program.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But while Freeman loved to act, flying — in particular the idea of being a fighter pilot—was in his heart of hearts. And so, upon graduating high school in 1955, Morgan turned down a partial drama scholarship and joined the U.S. Air Force. The military, though, proved to be much different than what he'd expected. Instead of darting around the skies, Morgan was relegated to on-the-ground activity as a mechanic and radar technician. He also realized that he didn't want to be shooting down other people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1959, Freeman left the Air Force and tried his fortunes out West, moving to Hollywood to see if he could make it as an actor. It wasn't an easy life. He took acting classes and struggled to find work.

His parents divorced when he was very young, and Percy and his four siblings were raised by their father in New Orleans' Calliope Projects, a neighborhood infamous for its high crime rate.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He says that the turning point in his childhood came at age 16, when he saw a former resident of the Calliope Projects, who had left to become an insurance salesman, return to the neighborhood in a Mercedes-Benz.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Percy attended high school in New Orleans, starring as a point guard on the basketball team. After graduating in 1987, he briefly enrolled at the University of Houston to play basketball. However, he dropped out just months into his freshman year and transferred to Merritt Junior College in Oakland, California. He was studying business at Merritt when his grandfather passed away, and Miller received $10,000 as part of a settlement awarded his family due to the circumstances of the death. Armed with nothing but the settlement money and two years of business classes, Percy opened his own record store, No Limit Records, in nearby Richmond, California.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Miller used his record store to scope out sales trends in the hip-hop industry. After perceiving an unfulfilled demand for more hard-edged gangster rap music, he expanded No Limit into a record label and self-produced his own debut album, under the name Master P, called&nbsp;<em><u>Get Away Clean</u></em>, in 1991. Neither that album nor his second album sold well, and he decided to move No Limit Records back to his hometown of New Orleans.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There Master P achieved his first real success with the 1994 album,&nbsp;<em><u>The Ghettos Tryin' to Kill Me</u></em>, and its 1995 follow-up,&nbsp;<em><u>99 Ways to Die</u></em>. Operating without a national distribution deal, Master P promoted the albums via word-of-mouth to independent music stores, managing to sell a quarter-million copies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rappers had historically focused more on the artistic and glamorous side of hip hop music while paying very little attention to the business, investment and financial aspects. All that changed in 1996 when Master P signed a music distribution deal with Priority Records, one where No Limit Records would retain 100% ownership of their master recordings and keep 85% of their record's sales while giving Priority 15% in return for pressing and distribution which allows No Limit to profit from future sales such as catalogs and reissues. Master P went on to make hundreds of millions of dollars from this deal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He released his next album,&nbsp;<em><u>Ice Cream Man</u></em>, later that year and it peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard album charts. For the next several years, No Limit Records dominated the hip-hop industry, churning out a slew of hit records. By 1997, No Limit Records had expanded to include a bevy of prominent hip-hop stars. During its most productive years (1997-99), No Limit released 46 albums that frequently crowded the top of the Billboard charts.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Master P capitalized on the success of No Limit Records to expand into a host of other ventures. He explained his business model: \"<em>You spread out because you never know when it's going to end. Business is like a seesaw going up and down. When one goes down, I have the other one going up. You have to think like that if you want to survive</em>.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Master P's first new enterprise was No Limit Films. In 1997, he personally funded and produced his first film&nbsp;<em><u>I'm Bout It</u></em>, earning an enormous profit when the film proved a surprise hit. This success landed No Limit Films a national distribution deal with Miramax. In another surprising extension of his entertainment empire, Master P founded No Limit Sports Management in 1997.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the same time as he entered the sports management business, Master P also plunged into the pro sports world as a basketball player. In 1998, he earned tryouts with the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and Toronto Raptors, greatly exceeding most expectations but ultimately failing to land on an NBA roster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite these setbacks, at the close of the 1990s Master P sat atop a self-made entertainment empire of grand scale. No Limit Records sold 75 million albums during the decade, and in 1998 Forbes magazine ranked Master P 10th on its list of highest-grossing entertainers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>More recently in June of 2020, Master P announced his own rice brand, Uncle P's Louisiana seasoned rice, which he hopes major retailers will begin selling.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And in July of 2020, Master P released the <em><u>No Limit Chronicles</u></em>, a five-part BET docuseries on his New Orleans-based hip-hop label. The series shares stories of Master P’s career as a record executive and businessman, underscoring the unprecedented distribution deal with Priority Records that made No Limit Records a powerhouse record label.On his day, we salute the astute businessman, and entertainment mogul, Percy “Master P” Miller!

Both his parents were pianists. When Edward was a child, his family showed racial pride and support in their home, as did many other families. Black people in D.C. worked to protect their children from the era's Jim Crow laws.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Daisy Ellington surrounded her son with dignified women to reinforce his manners and teach him elegance. His childhood friends noticed that his casual, offhand manner and dapper dress gave him the bearing of a young nobleman, so they began calling him \"Duke.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Duke Ellington started out as a sign painter. He built his music business through his day job: when a customer asked him to make a sign for a dance or party, he would ask if they had musical entertainment; if not, Ellington would offer to play for the occasion. Later, Duke Ellington moved out of his parents' home and bought his own as he became a successful pianist.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Duke Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s onward and gained a national profile through his orchestra's appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem. In the 1930s, his orchestra toured in Europe. Although widely considered to have been a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, Ellington embraced the phrase \"<em>beyond category</em>\" as a liberating principle and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music rather than to a musical genre such as jazz.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some of the jazz musicians who were members of Ellington's orchestra are considered to be among the best players in the idiom. Ellington melded them into the best-known orchestral unit in the history of jazz. Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades. A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format, Ellington wrote more than one thousand compositions; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, with many of his pieces having become standards.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ellington also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, for example Juan Tizol's \"<em>Caravan</em>\", and \"<em>Perdido</em>\", which brought a Spanish tinge to big band jazz. In the early 1940s, Ellington began a nearly thirty-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn, whom he called his writing and arranging companion.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With Strayhorn, he composed many extended compositions, or suites, as well as additional short pieces. Following an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival, in July 1956, Ellington and his orchestra enjoyed a major revival and embarked on world tours. Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era, performed in several films, scored several, and composed a handful of stage musicals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ellington was noted for his inventive use of the orchestra and for his eloquence and charisma.

Her father owned and operated several successful businesses, while her mother kept house and took in boarders.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Her teenage years were tumultuous. Loretta had given birth to two children that had resulted from her being raped at age 11. At the age of 14, at the encouragement of her grandmother, Loretta ran away to Cleveland, Ohio, joining a traveling vaudeville-style minstrel show where she sang and entertained. In 1909, a year after leaving, both her parents were killed in tragic accidents.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Loretta quickly became one of the most successful entertainers of the “<em>Chitlin' Circuit</em>,” which was a name for black-owned clubs and performance halls that offered work to black entertainers. Though a product of segregation, these black clubs were safe and comfortable places for both black audiences and performers. While traveling with the show, Loretta became involved with fellow performer Jack Mabley. Though they never married, she began to use the name Jackie Mabley.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the arrival of the 1920s and the beginning of the Harlem Renaissance, Jackie found her way to New York where she performed her act in such famous venues as the Cotton Club and the Savoy Ballroom.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the 1930s, the Depression slowed the entertainment business, and Jackie made ends meet by working at church socials and movie houses. By 1939, Jackie began to appear regularly at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, where over the next 35 years she would perform more than any other entertainer. Here she continued to develop her comedic act—the salty old lady with the stretchy face and gravelly voice. It was at the Apollo that she acquired the nickname \"<em>Moms</em>\" from her fellow performers who appreciated her nurturing sympathy.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though Moms Mabley's act may seem stereotypical to some, it was really quite a clever show business ploy. While attractive young women, particularly black women, could show little in the way of intelligence or sexuality without condemnation, \"Moms\" was safe—because she was nonthreatening. From behind the shabby clothes and toothless grin, Mabley could offer sharp-witted insights and social commentary that would have been unacceptable from a more serious source.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beloved by black audiences, Moms Mabley's whole persona was an \"inside\" joke, and she did not hesitate to focus her scathing humor on whites and their ill treatment of other races. She also demonstrated glimmers of an early feminism with her jokes about old men and their illusions of authority. One of her trademark jokes was, \"<em>Ain't nothing an old man can do for me, but bring me a message from a young man</em>.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the 1960s, Mabley became known to a wider mainstream audience, playing Carnegie Hall in 1962, and making a number of mainstream TV appearances. Music became a regular part of her act and she had a song hit #35 on the Billboard Hot 100 on July of 1969, making Moms Mabley, who was 75 at the time, the oldest living person to have a U.S. Top 40 hit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moms Mabley continued performing in the 1970s.

His mother was a bank officer and property manager, and his father was a semi-professional baseball player and carpenter. Young Quincy was introduced to music by his mother, who always sang religious songs, and by his next-door neighbor who played piano. Quincy would listen through the walls. The neighbor recalled that after hearing her play, she could not get him off her piano.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1943, Jones and his family moved to Washington State where his father got a wartime job at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. After the war, the family moved to Seattle, where Jones attended high school. In high school, he developed his skills as a trumpeter and arranger.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At age 14, Jones introduced himself to 16-year-old Ray Charles after watching him play at a local club. Quincy cited Ray as an early inspiration for his own music career, noting that, our brother, Ray Charles overcame a disability (blindness) to achieve his musical goals.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1951, Jones earned a scholarship to Seattle University. After one semester, Jones transferred to what is now the Berklee College of Music in Boston. He left his studies after receiving an offer to tour as a trumpeter, arranger, and pianist with our brother, the bandleader Lionel Hampton, and embarked on his professional career.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the road with Hampton, he displayed a gift for arranging songs. He moved to New York City, where he received commissions for writing song arrangements. In 1953, at the age of twenty, Jones traveled with Lionel Hampton for a European tour.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In early 1956, Quincy played trumpet in the studio band that supported then 21-year-old Elvis Presley in his first six television appearances. During the 1950s, Jones toured Europe with a number of jazz orchestras. He also studied music composition and theory in Paris, France.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1961, Quincy was promoted from Musical Director to Vice-President of Mercury Records, becoming the first black person to hold the position. During the same year, at the invitation of the director, he composed music for the movie&nbsp;<em><u>The Pawnbroker</u></em>&nbsp;(1964). It was the first of his nearly 40 major motion picture scores. Following the success of&nbsp;<em><u>The Pawnbroker</u></em>, Jones left Mercury and moved to Los Angeles. Throughout his career he would compose theatrical scores not only for movies, but for a variety of TV shows as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the 1960s, in addition to his solo work as a musician, Jones worked as an arranger for several notable pop, jazz, and R&amp;B singers.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1975, he founded Qwest Productions, for which he arranged and produced successful albums by Frank Sinatra and others. In 1978, he produced the soundtrack for&nbsp;<em><u>The Wiz</u></em>, the musical adaptation of&nbsp;<em><u>The Wizard of Oz</u></em>, which starred Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. In 1982, he produced our brother, Michael Jackson's,&nbsp;<em><u>Thriller</u></em>, which would go on to become the bestselling album in the history of the music industry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Marking Jones's debut as a film producer,&nbsp;<em><u>The Color Purple</u></em>&nbsp;received 11 Oscar nominations that year.

Andre often attended a local nightclub to watch many DJs and rappers performing live. This particular nightclub had a back room with a small four-track studio. In was there where he recorded several demos. He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin' Cru in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early 1980s West Coast hip hop.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1986, Dr. Dre met our brother, O'Shea Jackson, known to us all as Ice Cube, who collaborated with him to record songs for Ruthless Records, a hip hop record label run by our brother, Eric Wright or Eazy-E. With two other members, they formed the rap group NWA.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NWA’s style of hip-hop was different than most other forms that existed at the time. The group called it, “<em>reality rap</em>,” offering stark descriptions of violent, inner-city streets. The group's first full album&nbsp;<em><u>Straight Outta’ Compton</u></em>&nbsp;became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After Ice Cube left NWA in 1989 over financial disputes, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group's second album, and he also produced tracks for a number of other acts on Ruthless Records.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a dispute with Eazy-E, Dr. Dre left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of Suge Knight, who positioned Dr. Dre as his flagship artist, and founded Death Row Records.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1992, Dr. Dre released his first single, the title track to the film&nbsp;<em><u>Deep Cover</u></em>, a collaboration with, our brother, Snoop Dogg. That same year, Dr. Dre's debut solo album&nbsp;<em><u>The Chronic</u></em>, was released under Death Row Records. Dr. Dre ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content, as well as introducing a number of new artists to the industry.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em><u>The Chronic</u></em>&nbsp;became a cultural phenomenon, its G-funk sound dominated much of hip-hop music in the early 1990s.

However, in March of 1996 Dr. Dre left the label amidst a contract dispute and growing concerns that Suge Knight was financially dishonest. Later that year, he formed his own label, Aftermath Entertainment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During the 2000s, Dre focused on producing other artists, and occasionally contributing vocals.

His mother was a bank employee and his father was an equipment supervisor. When he was five years old, he moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina. Jordan attended a local high school where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the varsity basketball team during his sophomore year but, he was deemed too short to play at that level.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of his high school’s junior varsity team, and tallied several 40-point games. The following summer, he grew four inches and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged more than 25 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he hit the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jordan joined the Chicago Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"Air Jordan\" and \"His Airness\".&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jordan won his first NBA championship with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1994 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball, but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1996 NBA season.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He retired for a second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments are astonishing, but among them include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, ten scoring titles, and five regular season MVP Awards.

Around this time, the NFL playoffs and coming of the Super Bowl enter the forefront of our minds. Not so much in recent years, but in the late 80s there were very few black quarterbacks in the NFL, and there was an undercurrent sense that black athletes did not possess the leadership qualities and instincts that it took to be successful in that position. Well, on this day, January 31, 1988, all of that thinking changed, thanks to one man, our brother Doug Williams. This is his triumphant story of victory. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4110,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DougWilliams4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4110\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Douglas “Doug” Lee Williams attended Grambling State University where he played under our brother, head coach Eddie Robinson. As quarterback, Doug guided the Tigers to a 36–7 (.837 winning percentage) record as a four-year starter, and led the Tigers to three conference championships.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1977, Doug Williams led the NCAA in several passing categories, including total yards from scrimmage, passing yards, and touchdown passes. Doug Williams finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting. Doug Williams graduated from Grambling with a bachelor's degree in education, and he began work on his master's degree before the 1978 NFL Draft.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite the success that he enjoyed on the field, a coach from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (HOF coach Joe Gibbs) was the only NFL coach that visited him for scouting purposes. Impressed by his poise, work ethic, and studious nature, the coach rated Williams as the best quarterback in the draft and recommended that the Buccaneers select Williams with their first-round draft choice.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4108,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DougWilliams6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4108\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Following the recommendation of Gibbs, Tampa Bay drafted Williams in the first round (17th overall) of the 1978 NFL Draft. Williams became the first black quarterback taken in the first round of an NFL draft. His first preseason pass drew a standing ovation from the Tampa Stadium crowd. In a 1979 game against the Chicago Bears, Doug Williams and our brother, Bears quarterback Vince Evans made history by making it the first NFL game ever to have a black starting quarterback on both teams.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Tampa Bay, which had won just two games in the first two years of the franchise, went to the playoffs three times in five seasons with Williams as starter and played in the 1979 NFC Championship game. During his time in Tampa Bay, Williams improved his completion percentage each season.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Williams was the only starting black quarterback in the NFL at that time. During his tenure with the Buccaneers, Williams was paid the lowest salary for a starting quarterback in the league, and less than the salary of 12 backups. After the 1982 season, Williams asked for a $600,000 contract. The Tampa Bay Bucs owner refused to budge from his initial offer despite the head coach’s endorsement.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4107,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DougWilliams7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4107\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Feeling disrespected by not being paid properly according to his merit, Doug Williams bolted to the upstart United States Football League's (USFL) Oklahoma Outlaws. The next season the Bucs went 2–14, and did not make the playoffs again until the 1997 season 14 years later. Over time, Tampa Bay’s willingness to let Doug Williams walk away over such a relatively small amount of money was seen as insensitive, especially as it came only months after Doug Williams’ wife passed away suddenly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1984, Williams led the Outlaws of the USFL in passing, however, after the USFL was shut down in 1986, Doug Williams returned to the NFL, joining the Washington Redskins. He was reunited with his former offensive coordinator, Joe Gibbs, who was now the team's head coach. Initially, Williams served as the backup for the starting quarterback, but after the starter became injured, Doug Williams stepped in and led the Redskins to an opening-day victory against the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1987 season.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4112,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DougWilliams2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4112\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Doug Williams would start three times in the 1987 regular season. While the subsequent two starts were losses, at the end of the season, when the Redskins had qualified for the playoffs, Williams was chosen as the starter. And on this day, January 31, 1988, before an international audience, he bravely led the team to Super Bowl XXII in which they routed John Elway and the Denver Broncos, becoming the first black quarterback to both play in and win a Super Bowl. He threw for a record (at the time) of 340 yards (and four touchdowns), and he was named the Most Valuable Player of the championship game.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4111,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DougWilliams3-770x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4111\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He suffered from injuries the following season and was outplayed by the bench player, who eventually won the starting job from Williams. Doug Williams would play one final season in 1989, as a backup.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Following his departure from the NFL, Williams worked on television in 1990 as a college football analyst for the Black Entertainment Television (BET).&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite enjoying the change of pace, Williams longed to return to football and when a high school head coaching position opened up in 1991 at a new high School in Louisiana, Doug Williams applied for the job and was hired for the position.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1992, Williams was able to move on to coach to his former high school. Playing its home games on a field bearing his name, Doug Williams was able to lead the team to an undefeated regular season.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Williams moved to the collegiate coaching ranks in 1994, when he was hired as the running backs coach for the football team of the United States Naval Academy. His other jobs in football have also included work as an offensive coordinator and as a scout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Doug Williams began his collegiate head coaching career at Morehouse College in 1997. He was named the head football coach at Grambling State University the following year, succeeding the legendary Eddie Robinson. He led the Tigers to three consecutive conference titles from 2000–2002, before leaving to rejoin the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a personnel executive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":4105,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://myblackhistorycalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DougWilliams9.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4105\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 2009, Doug Williams and fellow Grambling State alumnus James Harris co-founded the Black College Football Hall of Fame. Each year, several notable football players from historically black colleges and universities are entered in its hall of fame at an induction ceremony in Atlanta.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
